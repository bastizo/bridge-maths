## üõ†Ô∏è FULL STEPS TO BUILD A TRUSS BRIDGE MODEL (with Blueprint Design)

---

### ‚úÖ **Phase 1: Planning & Design**

#### **Step 1: Define Your Bridge Parameters**

* **Length:** 30 cm
* **Height:** 8 cm
* **Width:** 6 cm
* **Bridge Type:** Warren truss (triangle-based)
* **Scale:** 1:1 (1 cm on paper = 1 cm in real life for simplicity)

---

#### **Step 2: Draw the Side View (Blueprint on graph paper)**

üìê **Side View (Elevation) Blueprint**:

* Divide 30 cm into **6 equal sections (5 cm each)**.
* Draw **6 isosceles triangles** to form the truss pattern.
* Height from base to peak: **8 cm**.
* Connect the top and bottom beams with vertical and diagonal lines.

‚úèÔ∏è **Tools**: Graph paper, pencil, scale/ruler, protractor

```
Side View (draw on graph paper):
   /|\   /|\   /|\   /|\   /|\   /|\
  / | \ / | \ / | \ / | \ / | \ / | \
 /  |  V  |  V  |  V  |  V  |  V  |  \
/___|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|___\
<---------- 30 cm ----------> (base)
```

---

#### **Step 3: Draw the Top View (Deck Layout)**

üìê **Top View (Deck layout)**:

* A rectangle of **30 cm √ó 6 cm**
* Divide into 6 sections (5 cm each)
* Add **cross-bracing** or double-beam reinforcement

```
Top View (deck surface):
 ________________________________
|       |       |       |       |
|_______|_______|_______|_______|
<---------30 cm--------->  Width: 6 cm
```

---

#### **Step 4: Draw the Cross-Section (End View)**

üìê **End View** shows:

* Bridge height: 8 cm
* Bridge width: 6 cm

```
Cross Section View:
     |
     |   (height = 8 cm)
  ___|___
 |     |
 |     |   (width = 6 cm)
 |_____|
```

## üß± Phase 2: Gathering Materials

| Material             | Quantity          |
| -------------------- | ----------------- |
| Popsicle sticks      | \~100             |
| Wood/white glue      | 1 small bottle    |
| Cardboard (base)     | 1 sheet           |
| String (if needed)   | Optional          |
| Ruler + pencil       | 1 each            |
| Small weights (test) | 1‚Äì5 kg equivalent |

---

## üèóÔ∏è Phase 3: Construction

#### **Step 5: Build the Base Frame**

* Lay 2 long popsicle sticks **parallel** (30 cm apart).
* Connect them with **6 cross sticks** (spaced 5 cm apart).
* This forms your **bottom deck**.

#### **Step 6: Construct the Side Trusses**

* Use your blueprint to cut and glue triangles with equal lengths.
* Glue triangles to form a **Warren truss** or **Pratt truss** on both sides.
* Ensure all angles are accurate and sticks are symmetrical.

#### **Step 7: Assemble the Deck**

* Glue a flat surface (sticks or cardboard) over the bottom frame.
* This becomes the **road deck** of your bridge.

#### **Step 8: Connect the Two Side Trusses**

* Attach vertical popsicle sticks to link the left and right side trusses.
* Add **horizontal beams** across the top for strength.

#### **Step 9: Drying Time**

* Let the model dry for **6‚Äì12 hours** for full strength.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Phase 4: Testing and Analysis

#### **Step 10: Add Weight Slowly**

* Place small weights (books, stones) in the center and then at ends.
* Record when the bridge begins to **bend or fail**.

#### **Step 11: Measure Deflection**

* Use a ruler to measure how much the bridge sags under load.

#### **Step 12: Analyze Strength**

* Did triangle design help distribute the force?
* Which part broke first? Why?

| Item            | Cost (approx) |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| Popsicle sticks | ‚Çπ100          |
| Glue            | ‚Çπ30           |
| Base material   | Free          |
| **Total**       | **‚Çπ130**      |
